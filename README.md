# AzTF_vWAN

Monorepo for Terraform.
Developing Purely in this monorepo for Personal Development
Main goal is to expand Module knowledge along with improving IaC via Terraform (Testing object capabilities of state file will also be carried out for VM creation)

## Plans

Build and migration plans are versioned under [`docs/plans/`](docs/plans/README.md):

- [01 - VDI Terraform Platform Buildout](docs/plans/01-vdi-terraform-buildout.md) - greenfield module + environment build (Complete)
- [02 - Azure 1.0 to Terraform Migration](docs/plans/02-azure-1.0-to-terraform-migration.md) - porting the legacy estate onto the Terraform modules (**scaffold complete** — offline validate; live apply when creds ready)
